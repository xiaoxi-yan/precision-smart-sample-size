# A precision based sample size calculator for pilot SMART

The sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is a design used to develop dynamic treatment regimes (DTR) or adaptive interventions. Click on the ShinyApp calculator below for examples of SMART designs or see https://www.methodology.psu.edu/ra/adap-inter/example/. 

Given that DTRs are generally less well researched, a pilot study is often necessary. The ShinyApp https://xiaoxi-yan.shinyapps.io/prec-smart-ss/ allows user to calculate the sample size required for a pilot SMART up to a defined margin of error (precision). Users have a choice of 7 different possible SMART designs, two outcome types (binary or continuous), and two parameters of interest (effect of one DTR or difference in effects between two DTRs).
